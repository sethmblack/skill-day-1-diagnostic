## The Day 1 Framework

### What is Day 1?

Day 1 is the mentality of a startup - urgency, customer obsession, experimental mindset, and speed. It's not a date; it's a philosophy.

### What is Day 2?

"Day 2 is stasis. Followed by irrelevance. Followed by excruciating, painful decline. Followed by death." - Jeff Bezos, 2016 Shareholder Letter

Day 2 happens when organizations:
- Lose customer obsession
- Manage to proxies instead of outcomes
- Resist external trends
- Make decisions slowly

### The Four Dimensions of Day 1 Defense

Bezos identified four practices to maintain Day 1 at any scale:

**1. True Customer Obsession**
Not lip service - actual obsession with customer outcomes

**2. A Skeptical View of Proxies**
Processes, metrics, and procedures serve customers, not the reverse

**3. Eager Adoption of External Trends**
Embrace change; don't fight it

**4. High-Velocity Decision Making**
Speed matters; match process to decision type

---

## Assessment Framework

### Dimension 1: Customer Obsession

**Day 1 Indicators:**
- Decisions start with "What does the customer need?"
- Customer feedback directly influences priorities
- Leaders regularly interact with customers
- Customer metrics are primary success measures
- Bad customer experiences trigger immediate response

**Day 2 Indicators:**
- Decisions start with "What do competitors do?" or "What's our process?"
- Customer feedback is filtered through layers
- Leaders are insulated from customers
- Internal metrics (efficiency, cost) dominate
- Bad customer experiences are rationalized or ignored

**Diagnostic Questions:**
1. When was the last time leadership directly heard from a customer?
2. Can you name your top 3 customer pain points right now?
3. How long does it take for customer feedback to influence product decisions?
4. What percentage of meetings discuss customers vs. internal topics?

### Dimension 2: Proxy Management

**Day 1 Indicators:**
- Process serves outcomes, regularly questioned
- Metrics are tools, not goals
- "That's our process" is not a valid answer
- Rules have owners who can waive them
- Unusual situations get thoughtful exceptions

**Day 2 Indicators:**
- Process becomes the goal
- Hitting metrics matters more than outcomes
- "That's our process" ends discussions
- No one can approve exceptions
- Rules apply rigidly regardless of context

**Diagnostic Questions:**
1. Can you name a process that exists but no one questions why?
2. When metrics and reality conflict, which wins?
3. How easy is it to get an exception to a rule?
4. Do people optimize for dashboards or for customers?

### Dimension 3: External Trend Adoption

**Day 1 Indicators:**
- Actively scan for disruptive changes
- Embrace technological shifts early
- "How might this change our business?" is asked regularly
- Willing to cannibalize own products
- Invest in emerging capabilities before they're proven

**Day 2 Indicators:**
- External changes are threats to resist
- "That won't work in our industry"
- Defend existing products against disruption
- Wait for trends to be proven before acting
- Innovation happens elsewhere

**Diagnostic Questions:**
1. What emerging trend could disrupt your business in 5 years?
2. When did you last adopt a new technology before competitors?
3. Would you cannibalize a profitable product line to serve customers better?
4. How do you systematically learn about external changes?

### Dimension 4: Decision Velocity

**Day 1 Indicators:**
- Type 2 decisions made quickly by small groups
- 70% information is enough to act
- "Disagree and commit" is practiced
- Reversible decisions don't require extensive process
- Speed is valued and measured

**Day 2 Indicators:**
- All decisions require extensive process
- Wait for certainty before acting
- Disagreement prevents action
- Reversible decisions treated as irreversible
- Speed is not valued or measured

**Diagnostic Questions:**
1. How long does a typical decision take?
2. How many approvals does a small change require?
3. When did someone disagree, then commit fully?
4. What's the cost of moving slowly (is anyone tracking this)?

## Constraints

- Be honest, not diplomatic
- Specifics matter more than generalities
- Day 2 is not inevitable - it's a choice
- The diagnosis is useless without remediation
- Small organizations can be Day 2; large ones can be Day 1

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:** "Our startup has grown from 20 to 200 people in two years. We used to ship features weekly; now it takes months. Leadership spends most of their time in internal meetings. Can you assess what's happening?"

**Output:**

## Day 1 Diagnostic: [Company]

### Overall Assessment: EARLY DAY 2

The symptoms described are classic Day 2 onset. Growth has introduced coordination overhead that's choking execution speed. This is the most common trajectory - it's not inevitable, but it requires deliberate intervention.

### Dimension Scores

| Dimension | Score | Key Finding |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| Customer Obsession | 3/5 | Likely diluted by internal focus |
| Proxy Management | 2/5 | Process is becoming the goal |
| External Trends | 3/5 | Unknown - not enough information |
| Decision Velocity | 2/5 | Clear degradation from weekly to monthly |

**Overall Score:** 10/20 (Early Day 2)

### Detailed Findings

#### Customer Obsession (3/5)
- Leadership in internal meetings suggests customer distance growing
- At 20 people, everyone likely talked to customers
- At 200, layers exist between leadership and customers
- **Red flag:** How many hours per week does leadership spend with customers now vs. two years ago?

#### Proxy Management (2/5)
- "It takes months" suggests process accumulation
- Likely added: code review, design review, security review, legal review, launch review
- Each review makes sense individually; combined, they create stasis
- **Red flag:** Can anyone name which processes were added and whether they're still necessary?

#### External Trends (3/5)
- Insufficient information to assess
- Growth focus may have reduced external scanning
- **Question:** When did you last adopt something before competitors did?

#### Decision Velocity (2/5)
- Weekly to monthly is a 4x slowdown
- At 200 people, Type 2 decisions are probably being treated as Type 1
- Small teams likely can't ship without multiple approvals
- **Red flag:** How many approvals does a single feature require?

### Critical Symptoms

1. **Leadership in internal meetings** - This is how customer obsession dies
2. **Monthly vs. weekly shipping** - Speed degradation indicates process creep
3. **10x growth without deliberate Day 1 defense** - Day 2 is the default trajectory
4. **No one seems to have diagnosed this** - Suggests accepting Day 2 as normal

### Remediation Recommendations

**Immediate (Next 30 days):**
1. Leadership calendar audit: What percentage is customer-facing? Set target of 20%+
2. Decision audit: List last 10 decisions. Classify Type 1/Type 2. Were they processed appropriately?
3. Process inventory: List every approval required to ship a feature. Question each one.

**Short-term (Next 90 days):**
1. Implement two-pizza teams with single-threaded leaders who can ship independently
2. Create "fast track" for Type 2 decisions - no committee required
3. Monthly customer immersion: every leader spends one day with customers
4. Kill one process per month that's become a proxy

**Structural (6+ months):**
1. Reorganize around customer outcomes, not functions
2. Push decision-making to the edges - teams own their decisions
3. Create Day 1 metrics: time-to-decision, time-to-ship, customer contact hours
4. Annual process purge: justify every process or it dies

### Warning

You have a narrow window. Day 2 is a one-way door - once it sets in deeply, the people who thrive in Day 2 (process people, politicians, risk-avoiders) replace the people who thrived in Day 1 (builders, risk-takers, customer obsessives).

The fact that leadership noticed and is asking means there's still hope. But noticing is not fixing. The next 90 days will determine whether this is a temporary growth pain or a permanent cultural shift.

Ask yourselves: "Would we re-hire every person we've added in the last year?" If the answer isn't yes, you've already compromised on talent density, and talent decay accelerates Day 2.
